          <h3>About my work</h3>
          <p>Hello, I'm Alen.</p>
          <p>On my previous work that I left after 7+ years, I had a lot of responsibilities as IT.
          I was crm admin with 50+ users on daily basis and I was doing a lot of data analytics, reporting, development and migrations.<br/> 
          For databases I was using DBMS Microsoft SQL Server 2014 and Postgresql because I was monitoring data with more than > 1 million rows on weekly and monthly level.<br/>
          Also I have daily used tools like Power Query with DAX and Power Pivot for data manipulation and presentation. 
          I wanted to implement MSSQL Reporting Services in our office to automate some things, but sadly there was no space and time.
          For some business process I created small ado.net app that improved work of my colleagues. Nothing special, list of employers with their work details.
          We used web portal called e-learning, where I was preparing xml file with content about products of our company.
          I was editing it in admin editor (pictures, videos, hyperlinks and formating text) or directly using html and css.
          I also used SAP BO for querying data from company CRM apps. With slow internet link it was nightmare to pull out data. And then I moved to Belgium to live with my wife...</p> <br/><br/>
          <left><h3>My interests</h3></left>
          <p>I'm interested in wide area of technologies. Curently I'm sharping skills in Ruby,.NET and web. And I had played little with emberjs and it looks interesting, you can find small-tutorial app on my github place (have to try also glimmerjs). 
          In last couple of months I'm pushing myself to jogging 2 or 3 times per week. And I love to watch good movies with my wife.</p><br/>
