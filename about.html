          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hello, I'm Alen.</p>
          <p>I love IT and Scf movies!</p>
          <p>On my previous work that I had for 7+ years I had a lot of responsibilities as IT.
          I was crm admin with 50+ users on daily basis and I was doing a lot of data analytics, reporting, development and migrations.<br/> 
          For databases I was using DBMS Microsoft SQL Server 2014 and Postgresql because I was monitoring data with more than > 1 million rows on weekly and monthly level<br/>
          Also I have often used tools like Power Query with DAX and Power Pivot for data manipulation and presentation. 
          I wanted to implement MSSQL Reporting Services in our office to automate some things, but sadly there was no space and time.
          For some business process I created small ado.net app that improved work of my colleagues. Nothing special.
          I also used SAP BO for querying data from company CRM apps.</p> <br/><br/><br/>
          <h3>My interests</h3>
          <p>I'm interested in wide area of technologies. Curently sharping skills in Ruby and web. And I had played with asp.net core and emberjs. Some basic mvc staff. 
          In last couple of months I'm pushing myself to jogging 2 or 3 times per week. And I love to watch good movies with my wife.</p><br/>
